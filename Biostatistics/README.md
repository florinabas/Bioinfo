Project description: 
- Analyzed clinical data from a study of 29 patients receiving Botox treatment for migraines, focusing on treatment efficacy and factors influencing migraine frequency, intensity and presence of aura. Gained hands-on experience with R for data handling, visualization and statistical analysis, applied non-parametric tests and regression models to real clinical data and learned to interpret results in a biomedical context and communicate findings clearly.

Steps:
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Standardized variable formats, handled missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory Analysis: Visualized distributions, compared groups by age, gender, and aura.
- Statistical Testing: Applied Wilcoxon tests, ANOVA, and Levene’s test to assess differences in migraine outcomes.
- Regression Modeling: Built linear and logistic regression models to quantify the impact of treatment and patient factors on migraine intensity and aura presence.
- Prediction & Interpretation: Predicted outcomes for missing data points and evaluated model performance.
