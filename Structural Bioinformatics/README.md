Project description: 
- Conducted a structural bioinformatics study of Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the main predicted molecular target of Ibuprofen. The project involved identifying the target using SwissTargetPrediction, retrieving functional and structural data from UniProt and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and performing detailed 3D structural analysis with UCSF Chimera. Additionally, protein surface pockets and binding cavities were characterized using CASTp to better understand potential interaction sites.

Steps:
- Predicted Ibuprofen molecular targets using SwissTargetPrediction based on SMILES similarity.
- Selected COX-1 as the primary target and retrieved its sequence and functional information from UniProt (P23219).
- Downloaded the crystallographic structure PDB: 6Y3C from the Protein Data Bank.
- Visualized the structure in UCSF Chimera, examining: backbone and full-atom representations, secondary structure elements, ligand positioning, hydrophobic surface and electrostatic potential, protein surface and volume calculations and structural comparison using RMSD.
- Identified and measured binding pockets and surface cavities using CASTp, including the main cavity.
