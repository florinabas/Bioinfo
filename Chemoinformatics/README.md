Project description: 
- Performed a chemoinformatics analysis of key organic compounds in Coffea robusta. The project included identifying major constituents (e.g., caffeine, chlorogenic acids, fatty acids), characterizing their physicochemical properties, and predicting ADME/Tox profiles using multiple in-silico tools. A molecular docking study was also carried out to evaluate interactions between octadecanoic acid and a human CYP enzyme.

Steps:
- Collected major coffee compounds from FooDB and retrieved physicochemical data from PubChem.
- Predicted ADME and drug-likeness using SwissADME (GI absorption, BBB permeability, CYP interactions).
- Evaluated toxicity and safety using admetSAR, Pred-hERG, Pred-Skin, and CarcinoPred-EL.
- Performed ligand–protein docking of octadecanoic acid with a human cytochrome using SwissDock, AutoDock Vina, PLIP, and PatchDock/FireDock.
